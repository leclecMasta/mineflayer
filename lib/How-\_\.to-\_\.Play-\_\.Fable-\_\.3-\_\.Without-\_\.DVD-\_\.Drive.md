However, some players may encounter a problem when trying to play Fable 3 on their PC. The game requires a DVD drive to run, and some users may not have one or may have a faulty one. In this case, the game will display an error message saying "no dvd drive detected" and will not launch.
 
Fortunately, there are some ways to bypass this issue and play Fable 3 without a DVD drive. Here are some possible solutions:
 
- Use a virtual drive software. This is a program that creates a virtual DVD drive on your computer and allows you to mount an image file of the game disc. Some examples of virtual drive software are Daemon Tools, PowerISO, and Alcohol 120%. You can download them from their official websites or from other sources. To use them, you need to have an image file of the Fable 3 disc, which you can create using another program or download from the internet. Once you have the image file, you can mount it using the virtual drive software and run the game as if you had a physical disc.
- Use a crack file. This is a modified version of the game executable that removes the DVD check and allows you to run the game without a disc. You can find crack files for Fable 3 on various websites that offer pirated games or game fixes. However, be careful when downloading crack files, as they may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer. You should also scan them with an antivirus program before using them. To use a crack file, you need to replace the original game executable with the cracked one in the game folder. You may also need to disable your antivirus program or firewall temporarily, as they may block the crack file from running.
- Use a trainer or cheat engine. These are programs that modify the game memory and enable various cheats or features that are not normally available in the game. Some trainers or cheat engines may also have an option to disable the DVD check and allow you to play Fable 3 without a disc. You can find trainers or cheat engines for Fable 3 on websites that offer game hacks or mods. However, as with crack files, be careful when downloading trainers or cheat engines, as they may also contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer. You should also scan them with an antivirus program before using them. To use a trainer or cheat engine, you need to run it before or after launching the game and activate the desired options.

These are some of the ways to play Fable 3 without a DVD drive. However, keep in mind that these methods may not work for everyone and may have some risks or drawbacks. For example, using virtual drive software may slow down your computer performance, using crack files may cause compatibility issues or bugs in the game, and using trainers or cheat engines may affect your game balance or achievements. Therefore, use these methods at your own discretion and responsibility.
 
If you want to play Fable 3 legally and safely, you should buy the game from an official source and install it on a computer that has a working DVD drive. Alternatively, you can buy the game from Steam or other digital platforms that do not require a disc to play.
